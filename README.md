https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.html

Here I explore:
1. Turning RGB image into grayscale
2. Flipping image vertically and horizontally
3. Extract RGB pixels and visualize through histogram
4. Using thresholding to filter image
5. Explore Global thresholding and other thresholding techniques inside the package
